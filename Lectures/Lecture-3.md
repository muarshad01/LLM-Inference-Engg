#### MLA
* Shift focus from reducing the number-of-heads to compressing the informtion within these heads.
* What if we don't have to cache K & V seperately.
* What if, we could first project our input (X) into a single, combined, much smaller matrix, a latent matrix ($$C_{KV}(4,4) = X(4,8) \times W_{dKV}(8,4)$$) and cache only that!
* This is the central idea of MLA:
* Instead of caching two large matrices, K & V, we only cache one smaller, lower dimensional matrix $C_{KV}$.
* This single matrix becomes our highly efficient cache.
* When we need the full Keys ($K$) and Values($V$), we can resonstruct them on the fly from the compressed latent representation ($C_{KV}$).
