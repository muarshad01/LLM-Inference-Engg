#### Inference
* Time to First Token (TTFT)
* Inter-token latency (ITL)
* Tokens per second (TPS or t/s)

#### Qwen Optimizations
* Attention (Flash Attention)
  * MHA
  * MQA
  * MLA
* State Space Models (SSA)
  * Mixture of SSM like Mamba architecture with sliding-window
* Quantization
* Speculative Decoding (Multiple tokens are generated at the same time together, so that, Inference becomes faster.)
* Parallelism (Amount of memory on GPU takes reduces, so that, Inference becomes faster.)
* Disaggregated Serving (Decouple prefill and decode)
